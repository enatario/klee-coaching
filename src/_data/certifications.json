For the past 19 years of my journey, I was privileged to serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier, PA. I was honored and fortunate to work with, and learn from, such a talented and generous group of team members, club officials and mentors throughout the years. Helping others and ‘giving back’ remain my mission today."
