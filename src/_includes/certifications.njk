      <h3>39 years of leadership experience</h3>
      <p>I graduated in 1980 from Penn State with a degree in Hospitality Management. I worked as a leader in the club management field thereafter until retiring in early 2019. For the last 19 years of my journey I was privileged to serve as the Chief Operating Officer of Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier, PA. I was honored and fortunate to work with, and learn from, such a talented and generous group of team members, club officials and mentors throughout the years. Helping others and ‘giving back’ remain my mission today.</p>

      <h3>Encore career in coaching</h3>
      <p>During the final years leading up to retirement, I crafted an encore career roadmap to continue my leadership adventure. In July of 2019, I attended Georgetown University in pursuit of a certificate in Executive Leadership Coaching. Georgetown’s Executive Leadership programs are some of the most highly regarded in world. I completed those studies and earned certification in March of 2020.</p>

      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>Confidentiality is essential to building the trust required for an effective working relationship between client and coach. In addition, as a member of the International Coaching Federation (ICF) I am bound to adhere to a code of ethics in all my interactions. The <a href="https://coachfederation.org/code-of-ethics">ICF Code of Ethics</a> describes the core values of the ICF, and ethical principles and ethical standards of behavior for all ICF Professionals.</p>
